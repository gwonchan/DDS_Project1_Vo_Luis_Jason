# Case Study 01 - Beers and Breweries
We will be taking the Beers and Breweries datasets and perform an EDA and KNN model testing. Our audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser. We will be finding any relationships between ABV and IBU and we will be answering 9 main questions.

## Datasets
The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries. The datasets descriptions are as follows. We will be using R to perform statistical analysis.

### Beers.csv:  
Name: Name of the beer
Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer  
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer  
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer  
Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer  
Style: Style of the beer  
Ounces: Ounces of beer  

### Breweries.csv:  
Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery  
Name: Name of the brewery  
City: City where the brewery is located  
State: U.S. State where the brewery is located  

## Questions
1.	How many breweries are present in each state?  
2.	Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations the merged file.  
3.	Address the missing values in each column.  
4.	Compute the median ABV and IBU for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.  
5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?  
6.	Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.  
7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content?  
8.	Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs and other types of Ale.
